# BulletinUrlShortener


To run: 
- Clone repository
- Navigate to the root directory of the project in a CLI program that can run java
- run: `java -Dfile.encoding=windows-1252 -jar .\target\CodeTest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

If that does not work, you can run this from your IDE. I use Intelij. The main class is at `com.bulletinCodeTest.CodeTest.CodeTestApplication`.
You should be able to run the main function there.
